# Resume Enhancement Assistant

## Context

I want to create a more comprehensive resume that accurately reflects my full skillset while maintaining honesty and conciseness. My current resume primarily focuses on skills I want to work with, but I have additional experience with:

- Software development design principles
- Cloud technologies
- Programming languages (Scala, some Rust)
- Various technical skills I consider hobby-level

## Objective

Help me enhance my resume by identifying opportunities to include relevant skills and experiences without misrepresentation or unnecessary bloat.

## Instructions

1. Review my original resume and list of accomplishments (provided below)
2. Analyze gaps between my accomplishments and what appears on my resume
3. Recommend specific additions that would strengthen my resume while maintaining authenticity
4. Suggest concise phrasing for each addition that balances honesty with effective self-presentation
5. Prioritize additions based on their likely impact on employers
6. If any skills seem too hobby-level to include, explain your reasoning

## Guidelines for Recommendations

- Focus on factual representation rather than exaggeration
- Suggest appropriate placement within resume sections
- Consider both technical skills and transferable competencies
- Indicate confidence levels for different skills where appropriate (e.g., "proficient in", "familiar with")
- Maintain brevity while maximizing impact
