# coding-scratch
place where I'm storing stuff I use to learn. not trying to over-organize here or get ambitious. Here's the deal. my affirmation is "you thrive on deep learning and meaningful creation, not passive consumption. this is who you really are." So go do that. learn stuff. make stuff. use this to give yourself permission to work hard in the cracks.
