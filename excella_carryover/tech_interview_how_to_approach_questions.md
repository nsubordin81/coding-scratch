The key is to demonstrate both depth and breadth while showing you can operate at the appropriate level for each role. Here's how to approach it:

**Start with clarification and scope definition**

- Ask clarifying questions about requirements, constraints, and scale
- Define assumptions explicitly
- Identify the core problem vs. symptoms
- This shows senior-level thinking and prevents solving the wrong problem

**Structure your response systematically**

- Break complex problems into components
- Discuss trade-offs explicitly (performance vs. maintainability, cost vs. speed, etc.)
- Present multiple approaches when relevant
- Show you can think beyond just "making it work" to "making it work well"

**Demonstrate appropriate technical depth**

- For staff engineer roles: dive deep into system design, scalability, and technical leadership decisions
- For solutions engineer roles: focus on practical implementation, customer needs, and bridging technical/business gaps
- For solutions architect roles: emphasize high-level design, integration patterns, and strategic technical decisions

**Show your collaborative mindset**

- Explain how you'd involve team members in decisions
- Discuss how you'd communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
- Mention considerations for team skills, maintenance burden, and knowledge transfer

**Address the full lifecycle**

- Don't just design the solution - discuss deployment, monitoring, maintenance, and evolution
- Consider failure modes and recovery strategies
- Think about documentation and operational concerns

**Use concrete examples from your experience**

- Reference similar problems you've solved
- Mention specific technologies and their trade-offs
- Show pattern recognition across different domains

The goal is proving you can think strategically while remaining grounded in practical implementation details.
