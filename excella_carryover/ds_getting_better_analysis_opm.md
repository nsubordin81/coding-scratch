This is a fascinating and challenging scenario that's increasingly common in AI/ML projects - evaluating LLM performance without ground truth labels in government/enterprise settings. Let me break down the methods you encountered and suggest additional approaches.

## What Your Team Was Doing (And Why)

**Inter-rater Reliability with Rubrics**
This is a gold standard approach when you can't get expert labels at scale. You're essentially creating your own ground truth by having multiple evaluators score the same content using standardized criteria. The statistical measures (Cohen's kappa, Fleiss' kappa, intraclass correlation) tell you if your evaluators agree enough to trust the scores.

**Information Gain for Resume Search**
Brilliant proxy labeling strategy. By using hiring outcomes (interviews/offers) as implicit relevance signals, they created a feedback loop. Information gain measures how much knowing a feature (like occupational series match) reduces uncertainty about the outcome (successful hire). This bypasses needing human relevance judgments.

**Monte Carlo for Document Classification**
Likely used for uncertainty quantification - running many simulations with different parameter assumptions to understand confidence intervals around document type predictions. This helps when you can't validate classifications directly.

## Methods for Your Scenario

**Semantic Similarity Without Labels**

_Embedding-based Clustering_

- Use sentence transformers to embed documents/queries
- Cluster similar items and manually inspect clusters for coherence
- Measure cluster quality with silhouette scores, adjusted rand index
- Look for natural groupings that align with domain knowledge

_Cross-encoder Relevance Scoring_

- Use pre-trained models (like MS MARCO) to score query-document pairs
- While not perfect, gives you relative relevance rankings
- Can establish baselines and compare different approaches

**Proxy Label Generation**

_Behavioral Signals_

- Click-through rates, time spent on results
- Query reformulation patterns (users refining searches)
- Session success metrics (did they complete their task?)

_Domain-specific Heuristics_

- For job search: salary range alignment, location matching, required skills overlap
- For resume search: years of experience, education level, previous role similarity
- Create composite scores from multiple weak signals

**Statistical Evaluation Without Ground Truth**

_Comparative Evaluation_

- A/B testing between different approaches
- Preference judgments (even internal team members ranking results)
- Bootstrap sampling to estimate confidence intervals

_Intrinsic Quality Metrics_

- Coherence measures for generated text
- Diversity metrics for search results
- Consistency checks across similar queries

## Specific Techniques for Your Use Cases

**Position Description Authoring**

```
Evaluation Framework:
1. Coherence: Does the text flow logically?
2. Completeness: Are all required sections present?
3. Compliance: Does it match regulatory language patterns?
4. Specificity: Are duties and qualifications concrete?

Statistical Approaches:
- Text similarity to approved descriptions (cosine similarity)
- Readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid)
- Term frequency analysis against approved vocabulary
- N-gram overlap with successful examples
```

**Search Quality Without Relevance Judgments**

```
Indirect Measures:
1. Result diversity (avoid returning same document types)
2. Query-result semantic similarity distributions
3. Ranking consistency across similar queries
4. Coverage of different document types in top results

Pattern Recognition:
- Identify query types through clustering
- Look for consistent result patterns within query clusters
- Measure variance in results for similar queries
```

**Resume-Job Matching**

```
Proxy Evaluation:
1. Skill alignment scores (extract skills from both)
2. Experience level matching
3. Geographic feasibility
4. Education requirement satisfaction

Validation Approaches:
- Sample manual review of highest/lowest scoring pairs
- Cross-validation against known successful matches
- Temporal validation (older matches predict newer ones)
```

## Building Your Statistical Intuition

**Start with Exploratory Data Analysis**

- Distribution analysis of your key metrics
- Correlation matrices between different features
- Time series analysis if you have temporal data
- Outlier detection to find interesting cases

**Learn These Core Concepts**

- Confidence intervals and statistical significance
- Effect size vs. statistical significance
- Multiple testing correction (Bonferroni, FDR)
- Bootstrap sampling for robust estimates
- Cross-validation strategies

**Practical Tools**

- Learn to use scipy.stats for statistical tests
- Master pandas profiling for quick EDA
- Use scikit-learn metrics even for unsupervised tasks
- Plotly/seaborn for statistical visualization

## Why the Resistance to ML on Position Descriptions

Your colleagues were likely concerned about:

- **Sample size per category**: Each occupation/agency combination might have too few examples
- **Distribution mismatch**: Models trained on one agency might not generalize
- **Regulatory compliance**: Government text has specific language requirements
- **Interpretability**: Need to explain why the model made certain choices

However, you could argue for:

- **Transfer learning**: Start with general language models, fine-tune on government text
- **Unsupervised approaches**: Topic modeling, clustering to find natural groupings
- **Hierarchical modeling**: Learn general patterns, then specialize by domain
- **Feature engineering**: Extract regulatory-compliant phrases as features

## Moving Forward

**Build a Personal Toolkit**

1. Practice with simulated data where you know the ground truth
2. Learn to generate synthetic evaluation datasets
3. Master confidence interval calculation and interpretation
4. Study information theory basics (entropy, mutual information)

**For Your Next Project**

- Propose pilot studies with small, well-defined subsets
- Always include confidence intervals in your metrics
- Document your assumptions and limitations clearly
- Build in human-in-the-loop validation from the start

The key insight is that in the absence of ground truth, you're essentially doing scientific hypothesis testing - forming theories about what good performance looks like and designing experiments to test those theories with the data you have available.
