I'll break down each month with specific daily and weekly activities, resources, and milestones.

## Month 1: Statistical Foundation Blitz

### Week 1: Distributions & Descriptive Statistics

**Monday: Theory Day (30 mins)**

- Read: Khan Academy "Intro to Statistics" (free)
- Focus: Normal distribution, why it matters
- Connect to ML: Why we assume normality for many algorithms

**Tuesday-Thursday: Hands-on Practice (45 mins each)\*\***Friday: Integration Day (1 hour)\*\*

- Use your music dataset (Spotify API or Last.fm)
- Apply the distribution analysis template
- Write a brief summary of findings

**Weekend: Review & Connect**

- Review the week's concepts
- Connect to your ML knowledge: "Why do we assume normality in linear regression?"

### Week 2: Confidence Intervals & Bootstrap

**Monday: Theory (30 mins)**

- Watch: StatQuest "Confidence Intervals" on YouTube
- Read: Connect CIs to model uncertainty you know from ML

**Tuesday-Thursday: Progressive Exercises**### Week 3: Hypothesis Testing

**Focus**: Connect to A/B testing concepts you've seen in ML
**Daily Structure**: 30 min theory, 45 min practice### Week 4: Information Theory & ML Evaluation

**Focus**: Connect statistical concepts to ML evaluation metrics

**Daily Activities**:

- Learn entropy, mutual information, information gain
- Apply to feature selection and model evaluation
- Practice with your government text classification problems

## Month 2: Applied Practice

### Week 5-6: EDA Mastery

**Goal**: Eliminate your EDA anxiety with structured approaches

**Week 5**: Use the statistical EDA template on 3 different datasets
**Week 6**: Modify the template for your specific domains (text, music, etc.)

### Week 7-8: Experimental Design

**Focus**: Design proper experiments for your LLM evaluation scenarios## Month 3-4: Integration & Advanced Topics

### Week 9-10: Portfolio Projects

**Choose 2 projects from your interests:**

1. **"80s vs 90s Music Analysis"** - Complete statistical comparison
2. **"LLM Search Evaluation"** - Apply your government experience
3. **"Gaming Performance Analysis"** - Speedrun or strategy analysis

### Week 11-12: Advanced Methods

**Information Theory Applications**:

- Mutual information for feature selection
- Entropy for measuring uncertainty
- KL divergence for model comparison

### Week 13-16: Specialization

**Choose based on your career goals:**

- **Bayesian Methods** for uncertainty quantification
- **Time Series Analysis** for performance monitoring
- **Causal Inference** for policy evaluation

## Monthly Check-ins & Milestones

**Month 1 Goal**: "I can calculate and interpret confidence intervals for any statistic"
**Test**: Take any dataset, bootstrap confidence intervals for mean, median, correlation

**Month 2 Goal**: "I can design and execute proper statistical experiments"
**Test**: Design A/B test for LLM evaluation with proper power analysis

**Month 3 Goal**: "I can evaluate ML systems without ground truth using statistical methods"
**Test**: Reproduce one of the methods your colleagues used on your government project

**Month 4 Goal**: "I can propose novel statistical approaches to ML evaluation problems"
**Test**: Present a new evaluation methodology to your team

## Daily Time Commitment

**Weekdays**: 45-60 minutes (30 min theory, 30 min practice)
**Weekends**: 1-2 hours (longer practice sessions, project work)
**Total**: ~7 hours per week

## Weekly Structure Template

**Monday**: Learn new concept (theory focus)
**Tuesday**: Implement from scratch (understanding focus)
**Wednesday**: Apply to real data (practice focus)
**Thursday**: Connect to ML concepts (integration focus)
**Friday**: Mini-project or review (application focus)
**Weekend**: Longer project work, review week's concepts

## Success Indicators

**Month 1**: You stop looking up basic statistical functions
**Month 2**: You can critique statistical analyses you read
**Month 3**: You propose statistical solutions in work meetings
**Month 4**: Colleagues ask you statistical questions

**The key insight**: You're not learning statistics from scratch - you're connecting statistical thinking to ML concepts you already understand. This accelerates your learning significantly compared to someone starting fresh.

Your software engineering background is actually a huge advantage here. You understand systems, debugging, and validation - all crucial for applied statistics. You just need to learn the statistical vocabulary and framework to formalize your intuition.
