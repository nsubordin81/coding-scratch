I'll give you a structured learning path that builds from foundational concepts to advanced application, with specific milestones and practical exercises.

## Phase 1: Statistical Foundation (2-3 months)

**Core Concepts to Master**
Start with these in order - each builds on the previous:

1. **Distributions and Descriptive Statistics**

   - Practice: Take any dataset and manually calculate mean, median, mode, variance
   - Learn to visually identify distribution shapes (normal, skewed, bimodal)
   - Exercise: Plot histograms and Q-Q plots for different variables
   - Milestone: Can look at a distribution and immediately know what statistical tests are appropriate

2. **Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing**

   - Understand the difference between confidence intervals and prediction intervals
   - Practice calculating both parametric and non-parametric confidence intervals
   - Learn when to use t-tests vs. Mann-Whitney U vs. chi-square tests
   - Exercise: Take A/B test data and calculate confidence intervals manually, then verify with scipy

3. **Bootstrap Sampling**
   - This is crucial for your scenarios - it lets you estimate uncertainty without assumptions
   - Practice: Implement bootstrap from scratch, then use scipy's bootstrap
   - Exercise: Bootstrap confidence intervals for correlation coefficients, model performance metrics
   - Milestone: Can estimate confidence intervals for any statistic, even complex ones

**Hands-on Learning Approach**

```python
# Weekly Exercise Template
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Week 1: Distributions
data = np.random.normal(100, 15, 1000)  # Generate data
# Calculate all descriptive stats manually
# Plot histogram, box plot, Q-Q plot
# Identify distribution type and parameters

# Week 2: Confidence Intervals
# Calculate 95% CI for mean using t-distribution
# Bootstrap CI for median
# Compare parametric vs non-parametric approaches

# Week 3: Hypothesis Testing
# Design and execute t-test, Mann-Whitney U test
# Interpret p-values and effect sizes
# Practice multiple testing correction
```

## Phase 2: Applied Statistics for ML (1-2 months)

**Evaluation Metrics Deep Dive**
Learn these beyond just the formula - understand when each is appropriate:

1. **Information Theory Metrics**

   - Entropy, mutual information, information gain
   - Practice: Calculate information gain for feature selection manually
   - Exercise: Use mutual information to rank features in a dataset
   - Real application: Understand why your colleagues used information gain for resume search

2. **Similarity and Distance Metrics**

   - Cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, edit distance
   - When to use each for different data types
   - Practice: Implement similarity measures from scratch
   - Exercise: Compare document similarity using different metrics

3. **Clustering Evaluation**
   - Silhouette score, adjusted rand index, calinski-harabasz score
   - Practice: Apply to real clustering problems
   - Exercise: Evaluate clustering quality without ground truth labels

**Practical Project**
Build a document similarity system using your government text:

- Extract features using TF-IDF and embeddings
- Calculate similarity matrices
- Evaluate clustering quality
- Bootstrap confidence intervals for similarity scores

## Phase 3: Experimental Design (1-2 months)

**A/B Testing and Causal Inference**
This is where you learn to design experiments properly:

1. **Power Analysis and Sample Size Calculation**

   - Learn to calculate required sample sizes for different effect sizes
   - Practice: Design A/B tests with proper power analysis
   - Tool: Use statsmodels or scipy for power calculations

2. **Multiple Testing Correction**

   - Bonferroni, FDR, Holm-Bonferroni methods
   - When to use each approach
   - Practice: Analyze multiple metrics simultaneously

3. **Observational Studies**
   - Propensity score matching, instrumental variables
   - Crucial for your government work where you can't randomize
   - Exercise: Use propensity scores to evaluate hiring outcomes

**Hands-on Project**
Analyze your resume search data:

```python
# Design evaluation without ground truth
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
from scipy.stats import bootstrap

# 1. Load your search results data
# 2. Define proxy metrics (occupational series match, etc.)
# 3. Calculate confidence intervals using bootstrap
# 4. Compare different search methods statistically
# 5. Control for multiple comparisons
```

## Phase 4: Advanced Methods (Ongoing)

**Information Theory Applications**

- Mutual information for feature selection
- Entropy for measuring uncertainty in predictions
- KL divergence for comparing distributions
- Cross-entropy for evaluating generative models

**Bayesian Approaches**

- Bayesian A/B testing (better for small samples)
- Bayesian confidence intervals
- Prior specification for domain knowledge

**Time Series and Sequential Analysis**

- For evaluating model performance over time
- Detecting concept drift statistically
- Sequential testing for early stopping

## Building Intuition Through Practice

**Weekly Routine**

- Monday: Read theory (30 minutes)
- Tuesday-Thursday: Implement concepts in code (1 hour each)
- Friday: Apply to real data/problem (2 hours)
- Weekend: Review and connect concepts

**Key Intuition-Building Exercises**

1. **Simulate Before You Calculate**

   ```python
   # Before using any statistical test, simulate data where you know the answer
   # Then verify your test gives the right result
   np.random.seed(42)
   group_a = np.random.normal(100, 15, 50)
   group_b = np.random.normal(105, 15, 50)  # 5 point difference

   # Now run t-test and see if it detects the difference
   # Repeat with different effect sizes to build intuition
   ```

2. **Bootstrap Everything**

   ```python
   # For any statistic you calculate, bootstrap the confidence interval
   # This builds intuition about uncertainty in your estimates
   def bootstrap_statistic(data, statistic_func, n_bootstrap=1000):
       # Implement and use regularly
   ```

3. **Always Visualize**
   ```python
   # Before any analysis, plot your data
   # After analysis, plot your results with confidence intervals
   # This builds visual intuition about statistical concepts
   ```

## Speaking the Language

**Key Phrases to Use**

- "What's the effect size?" (not just "is it significant?")
- "Let's bootstrap the confidence interval"
- "We need to control for multiple comparisons"
- "What's our statistical power for detecting this effect?"
- "Let's check the assumptions of this test"

**Questions to Always Ask**

- What are we trying to measure?
- What are our assumptions?
- How confident are we in this estimate?
- What would we conclude if we're wrong?
- How does this generalize beyond our sample?

## Measuring Progress

**Month 1 Milestone**: Can calculate and interpret confidence intervals for any statistic
**Month 2 Milestone**: Can design and execute proper hypothesis tests
**Month 3 Milestone**: Can evaluate ML models without ground truth labels
**Month 4 Milestone**: Can design experiments and handle observational data

**Final Goal**: When someone proposes a complex evaluation strategy, you can:

1. Understand the statistical reasoning
2. Identify potential issues or improvements
3. Implement it yourself
4. Propose alternative approaches

The key is consistent daily practice with real data, not just reading about concepts. Start with your government datasets and apply each concept as you learn it.
