# Leftunders Concept Sheet

## Theme

Humankind is capable of creating life, but then we don't always inherently appreciate the value of any life other than our own.

Better theme: being ostracized. blindly accepting other's definitions of you can cause you to lose the best parts of yourself.

**Musical inspiration:** when you are leaning into it creep by radiohead as one example, maybe some elliot smith for more,
When you want to rise against it: https://www.quora.com/What-songs-are-good-for-when-you-feel-left-out-and-treated-badly-by-people

This should be personal enough, can be the same story as below, but themes that resonate from this story have more to do with not allowing yourself to be defined by others.

Need to think of the spine for this, the thing that is wrong at the beginning that the characters should grow out of, then what change event is a realistic story event that could disrupt the world of the character and what lesson they would learn as a result of adapting to this change.

**Warning:** The premise of this sounds like Shrek. What was Shrek about? It was about an ogre who let the way other people felt about him justify him turning away from the world.

His story centered less on him allowing the opinions of others define and limit him, though. That theme was there, but the more central one had more to do with him being a recluse and missing out on life experiences and friends because he didn't think anyone could see him differently. If you veer into this territory, beware.

Shrek was well told and there are parallels with your story so you could lose originality if you let that affect you overly much. You need the flaw to be more tied to trip clop believing the narratives people create about him, and if possible really convey how he is unable to recognize the best parts of himself because of it.

Another sub theme here could be that conformity breeds contempt as it creates divisions between people, and it also keeps them from growing. In fearing things that are different, they become convinced that their mode of being is akin to an evolutionary advantage. While this can prevent them from making mistakes that the group has learned not to make, it can also blind them to opportunities to improve and prejudice them against others who represent differences.

It will be challenging to represent this with motifs that a player has to adapt to and learn through choices rather than having control of the player's choices and forcing them through a narrative.

## Spine

Once upon a time, there was a mutant living in the underground remains of a world that was left behind, as an offshoot of the population buried him and his kind and built a new civilization above. They lived in this new world and poured their refuse down onto the inhabitants of his home below.

Every day he looked on from a visual feed he had assembled in his improvised dwelling and admired the surface dwellers, but was jeered and dismissed by them in every encounter,

One day, another mutant with psychic abilities but a childish personality came under his care because it had caused a stir on the surface and it was under threat from surface dwellers,

Because of that, the mutant found himself taking on a protective role and chasing his new friend to the surface where he was forced to confront the ridicule of the surface dwellers and his own insecurities

Because of that he stumbled into a lab on the surface and learned that the psychic floating friend had come from an experiment that was causing a serious reaction that could put not only the surface but his home at risk

Because of that, he looked deeper into the lab and uncovered that his ancestors were engineered to be great builders and were also thought of as beautiful creatures by the scientists that came up with them. He learned that the prejudice against him was just another narrative developed later by a group that needed to feel superior.

(idea for some detail here, maybe his father or grandfather was one of two great engineer/scientist types. Both he and his colleague were mutants, but it was based on mutations that started over time and were actually designed to help them cope with the changes to earth. His colleague wanted to reverse all genetic mutation, treating the original form of humanity as an ideal, and he saw the value in what they had become and wanted to maintain the full expression of it. Ultimately the other side of the argument won out and they started these experiments to return themselves to human form, but his ancestor fled underground with remaining mutants. The issues with the world, radiation and pollution that is ravaging both the above ground level and the below ground are all coming from efforts of the above ground mutants to continue to look like humans, but they blame all the problems caused by what they are doing to themselves on the mutant population below the surface, most of the ones who are above ground don't even realize the truth, just the upper echelon.

Because of that, he had to start believing in his abilities and relying on his friend while also protecting him from the harm that the surface dwellers prejudice caused

Until finally he allied with the underground creatures and his friend and some surface dwellers to stop the threat, getting past the narrative that separates him from surface dwellers and recognizing that his unique qualities had unimpeachable value.

## Character Development Themes

Being a social outcast can lead to self-doubt and approval-seeking behavior. When constantly facing ridicule or dismissal, a person may start believing they have little inherent value and begin looking externally for validation rather than recognizing their own positive qualities. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle where feeling inadequate leads to withdrawal, which can give others more justification for exclusion.

The character might start to resent their unique qualities, seeing them only as weaknesses. Being kind becomes being a "pushover," being creative becomes being "disorganized," having imagination becomes being "distracted," and being playful becomes being "childish." Over time this can develop into a distorted self-image, making things feel either grandiose or worthless with little middle ground.

The redemption arc involves recognizing that there are positive sides to the character's essence that will be instrumental in solving the problems they face. This growth typically requires supportive people who believe in the character to help them see their own value.

**Notes** - delve into the reasons the surface dwellers choose to demonize trip clop. Show an understanding of their reasons.
Make the villain the emotion of superiority, fear-based lying. Show how overcoming this means getting past these emotions.

**Idea:** trip clop has the mechanical ability, but he still somehow views it as a weakness.

It would be really good to get across that feeling of being left out, the world that is designed should do that to the character. Have authority figures that reinforce this feeling, and maybe one or two confidants or people outside of the mindset of conformity that others have that are able to cope as role models.

This game could start when trip clop is younger, to show impressionability and how younger npcs are less nuanced in the way they ostracize, and how when time passes there are still things that civilization does for social hierarchy and ways that people who don't fit in are put on the fringes of society. Drawing parallels is ambitious but would be cool.

This might be a way to simulate game theory for social hierarchies: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6509-deep-learning-for-predicting-human-strategic-behavior.pdf

## Videogame Challenges to Storytelling

The player controls the character. This is good in the sense of instilling agency. However, in many movies the person watching identifies with the main character, and the movie makes that character flawed in some way. It seems like it would be hard to have a player controlled character demonstrate flaws in as compelling of a way as one controlled by the invisible hand of a director that is guiding them through the narrative.

Timing is important in movies, events within a single arc aren't separated by too much other activity because it would deaden the impact of the arc's purpose. It seems like if a game could be a long crescendo of rising action or a series of episodal mini stories then that could work, but to tell one ambitious story in a game where parts of the action are going to be taken up by mundane things like hacking and slashing at enemies, there is a problem. All events should be related to the story, trimming everything out that doesn't matter as much would be important.

Good article on the challenges of storytelling in games https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/191861/Should_games_have_stories.php. The ultimate argument here is that storytelling is a 'crutch' because it leaves choice up to the designer like a movie would, when the goal of interactive media is to leave the choice up to the player and have the world reflect the consequences of that choice.

So the scary big challenge then becomes, how to achieve the Pixar-like quality in evocative storytelling that puts the player through the same sets of engineered challenges that a movie would, except unlike in a movie, the game doesn't know how the character will act and react, and so it cannot as believably guide them to the growth experience. But wow, if they could then what a payoff!!

How to guide trip clop through this story in a way that only the coincidence/change that gets him into trouble and also the state machine that represents the world is an unforgiving logic machine, but it is one that is tuned such that if he embraces the goodness in his nature and allies with friends that bolster him against negative judgments, he will succeed.

This seems to involve making conscious decisions that you will have to put the player in the position of being mistreated and having to somehow own some part of that mistreatment, and then also to have some qualities that they grow to resent because it represents what they see as weakness that is keeping them in the outside group. Like, maybe as trip clop they can notice their aptitude for mechanical skill, but there should be plenty in the world to reinforce that this skill is 'uncool', 'childish in its lack of usefulness', 'gross' etc. and it will need to be rejected or shown inferior so thoroughly that the player has no choice but to admit some kernel of truth to that perspective, and that should grow, but at some point this skill is something that they will need to realize is important to the goals presented by the world. This is something that will have to click for them, much in the way it clicks for audiences when they watch a pixar movie, except instead of being shown a static story, they will have arrived at the conclusion themselves through their own determined actions. This could be thought of as a superior teaching tool because it is more akin to doing your homework than watching a lecture, things sink in when you actually do them. Even better would be if the game had them teach the lesson to someone else, but that is even more ambitious.

## Game Design Philosophy

**Things I've heard from youtube videos of GDC with Warren Spector and others:**

Games are different from Movies and Comics and Radio and Oral Storytelling, because they have all the elements. Some tricks that have been really good for movies for example are not good when applied to games. Warren Spector's thesis is that new media always borrow from existing media. Film can be thought of as the 20th century prime medium, video games are in an adolescent stage, but they have more storytelling building blocks than any other medium. No medium can survive without growing beyond the limitations of the media that preceded it. Is interactivity all we bring to the table? Question why we borrow from movies and when.

**Examples from movies:**

- Time, place and editing - movies break down the boundaries of time and place through editing to make movies represent more of a dream state. This won't fly in games, because the player needs to experience everything.
- The cut scene, cameras that move themselves and hide the center of action from the player
- Anything that takes control away from the player, really
- Having a character do something really cool to punctuate a scene. This is great in movies because you only get exposed to it once. In a game, if your player is able to get exposed to it multiple times then they are going to think it is silly or worse.
- Sets instead of worlds. In a movie set, everything is completely contrived to support immersion in the one version of the story that the director is willing to tell.

Notes from the ted talk about video games that stay with you. Last of us is given as an example, but also bioshock and that dragon cancer. Presenter asserts that agency makes for superior storytelling, and what is holding games back is primarily that all of their decisions in game design aren't tied to supporting the story. Interestingly she doesn't seem as hung up on the fact that choice should have huge impact, so much as mechanics can support storytelling and really make the player identify with the character and go through the experience as that character in a way that film never could.

## Possible Solutions for Mechanics

Make the game more like reality. What do I mean by that?

Music cuing emotional events is great for movies, but it rests on the premise that the game designer knows when those are going to be. Have sound and music normally occur as just part of the environment.

You want it to feel sandboxy, but remember, no simulation is ever going to beat real life, so you are still going to be building the illusion of some reality that is focused, which means you are pushing the player through some experience. You just don't want them to feel uninvolved. Their choices should have impacts, but the way the world reacts to those choices should feel more organic and less like they are being forced down a path. Having AI that is learning and reacting along specific parameters could help with this.

Have objectives and failure states just like any other game, but make sure that the objectives are meaningful to the story.

## Narrative Summary

2 mutant rejects, one a gifted mechanic that looks like a giant eyeball with arms, and the other a hyperactive psychic bundle of nerves, climb out of the waste to survive planned extinction and have a place in the world by ousting the scientists that classified them as a failed experiment.

## Early Ideas (some abandoned for now, some retained)

Levels are 2.5 d. most of the time it is a 2d platformer style like DKC, but in some areas allow the characters to move along the z axis back into the level to another 2D platform (the technical difficulty of inventing this type of 2.5D scared me off, but it led to the idea of following the two characters in an alternating fashion which I like). This makes it like a puzzle, because some of the depth gates can only be accessed by a particular character, or one, two or three of them in combination (there were originally going to be 3 mutants, but that is a whole other character and it might get too complicated for players to follow anyhow). Maybe sometimes one of the characters gets stuck on a 2D platform and you have to get the other to come bail them out. Also, maybe there are traps for the characters and the others have to come save them. There would be multiple levels and zones, but secret passageways in one level could lead to another.

Each player moves at a different speed and jumps at a different height, and additionally they each have special abilities that enable them to get through areas the other can't or use the depth gates that the others can't. Characters have a leveling system ala zelda. they get more vitality and learn new abilities particular to their unique types. The players can combine and perform super abilities when they are together.

## What makes this game different from other side scrolling RPG puzzle action platformers (metroidvania)?

My game will borrow mechanics from some of my favorite games, but not mimic any of them entirely. Additionally, it will attempt to merge some of the mechanics of these games with some original mechanics I am trying to design.

Levels that give the impression of continuous progress through a larger world space ala SMB (you go into the castle and then in the next scene you go to another castle. However, for my game, "completion" of a level will involve one of the two title characters going into a "station" and then focus will return to the other character, who appears to be going through another location in the world. They alternate leaving their stations.

One of the big driving differences I would like to employ is the tag team mechanic concept I have been working on. In many 2d platforming games the player can switch between multiple characters in various ways. Some that come to mind are Donkey Kong Country in which the player has control over which character they are using and can use their slightly different abilities by intentionally pressing the 'A' button on their gamepad (if both are available). In mario, the presence of luigi seems to more or less be to differentiate between two players playing through the game competitively, and in SMB2 you pick a character to play through the entire game at the outset. In X-Men or TMNT games, you had different abilities but again, you were either stuck with your selection, it was a 2P feature, or some other constraint such as death controlled how you switched.

In this version, you don't get to choose between the characters and they aren't going through the same set of levels. They are alternating and my plan is to design levels such that the actions of a character in one level impact the state of the other character's level. This sounds like something that has been done, I have never played a game using quite the same idea.

Character Movement is more like an action game at the beginning, and stays fairly action based, but there are RPG elements as taking and giving damage increase your vitality, intelligence, and lead to new physical maneuvers which either assist with navigating the world space.

I am trying to incorporate some of my favorite aspects of various genres that emphasize what makes them fun to me and diminishes as much as possible what I find tedious or overly simple about them. The principle driving the movement and combat mechanics is I never want the characters to have to hesitate. This is more like a mario game where you pretty much always know how to take out a baddie, so you can slow down and have fun with the emergence of the interacting systems or you can try and breeze through parts and hope you don't get hacked up in the process.

NPCs that are both helpful and harmful. The helpful ones are fellow mutants and the harmful ones are the surface dwelling basics and their technology (mechs, vehicles, mind controlled mutants, dangerous weaponry and installations of traps everywhere, giant robots).

There are equipment and vehicles strewn about the game world. part of the game takes place in the underbelly of the future earth where the mutants live (and are banished to). Down here the equipment might be abandoned construction and trash compacting equipment, drills, etc and the vehicles would be driven down by the enemies coming to exterminate you, or it would be other mobile construction equipment. There would be piles of trash to dig around in for items, because in this future much of the area immediately below and just above the surface of the planet have been converted to landfills with toxic materials abounding. Just above that, built into a layer with the skyscrapers etc. are all of the manufacturing plants that produce the goods that the new surface dwellers consume. The artistic aesthetic should emphasize that this is what the mutants are faced with. Above that is sealed so mutants don't escape to the new surface, and early thoughts have there maybe being some labyrinthian, possibly ethereal space that is put in as a buffer to prevent mutants from getting up where laws of physics might not apply. in each of these areas, the placement of items and vehicles should be drawn from the theme of the world space.

There are basic items which have one time use, like a rock you throw or a tool that fixes or breaks something, and then there are collectibles which REX can use to build mods for himself and Nervil and which Nervil can psychically send to him.

As Rex gets more intelligent, he builds things that give him cool abilities, like laser eye beams or a jet pack. As Nerville does, he learns new psychic abilities.

Having the most basic enemy (read "goomba") be the members race of 'improved' humans who have been sent down to destroy the unfortunate consequences of their experiments. In this way, the most basic enemies are operating most or all of the more difficult enemies and bosses. for example, there may be a giant death ray or some kind of electric fence our heroes have to cross, but one of the basics has to get there to activate it so taking them out prevents it.

Having a tight set of action mechanics that grow as levels get more difficult, but then also pick ups, installed equipment and constructed equipment, will mean that for many of the levels it should be easy to design multiple ways to get through obstacles. For example, you are playing as REX and you come upon an area where there is a big boulder in your way and a basic shooting at you with a laser cannon. maybe you have something that can break through the boulder already, maybe you have a physical attack which can damage the boulder, maybe Nervil can do something which will help REX, maybe REX is building a super suit and that is how he will eventually clear the area.

Nervil has night vision, so if REX can turn the lights off where Nervil is, he can surprise all of his enemies.

The scale of the world will be huge for a 2d platformer, which will allow for both intimate interior spaces and sprawling caves or landscapes. and in addition to the golden path there will be several alternative paths which will lead to secrets. The secrets will be able to be rewarding without being required to finish the game because of the extensive character progression. it may be necessary to go back and visit some areas, but it should be obvious when this is required.

## Ideas in Early Stages

The game starts in REX's house. At first, there is no action, the player is allowed to explore and go to the kitchen and the gym. Use this for some teachable moments about objects and combat. At some point the Player should find the living room and turn on the boosted TV channel he gets from the new surface and he sees an announcement that there is a planned extermination underway of all mutants in the underlands. He is a mechanical genius so he has an excellent alarm system and it alerts him that he has intruders incoming. He kicks into action, running to his communication base where he has been transmitting to other mutants as part of a resistance (these will be the NPCs that help you later). Then, he goes and the player makes him kick butt (it will be easy since it was a truckload of basics. Then he gets to practice driving a truck. There should be the concept of fuel, that way he can't just keep driving forever and the fuel could be a collectible.

Nervil's story starts off with Nervil in the middle of a junkpile, meditating. He doesn't live in as human of a manner as REX. Out of nowhere, he gets a vision of the extermination squad, and he has to go and save some other mutants. This will be the second intro, but it will require a way to teach the mechanics to the player for Nervil's character.

## Character Details

**So far, 2 characters**

- Some movement skills, some physical attacks
- Additional movement and attack skills are learned as you progress
- Scale is character is small and world is very large (need to figure out the exact scale to translate it to the world size)
- There are many enemies but each interacts in a specific way with the two characters
- Tag team mechanic (con: multi tasking, pro: interesting challenges)
- Levels are procedural, not all the time but in certain places to add replayability
- How to ensure the player is still able to have emergent experiences that are actually fun
- Level has to stay playable
- Platforms are large and far apart but there are a lot of ways to get from one to another

Think of original mechanics to move around based on:

- Rex's anatomy
- Nervil's wall climbing
- Skills they get
- Rex's mechanic genius
- Nervil's teleporting capability
- Enemies and their abilities
- Make it feel like getting to the next part of the level is due to the players mastery of a skill

## REX Info

- He can walk at a slower pace, he has to turn his whole body when he alternates between hands. he takes a while to accelerate and has a constant top speed. He has no inertia when stopping
- Walking into enemies would hurt rex and does him damage. Small enemies are knocked over or die, larger enemies knock rex backward
- Rex can walk over objects to pick them up and he can walk over switches in the landscape to turn them on
- Without skills, rex is unable to scale walls and get to high places
- On inclines, rex walks at his normal pace
- Walking over some objects activates them, others it puts them in the inventory
- If rex walks off a platform edge, he catches himself and hangs there
- REX uses tools (like in lemmings) but he has to find or build them first
- There is a narrative/mechanic aspect where REX is building super suits for himself and nervil
- REX can build things in the level space as well as repair them. Levels have lots of piles of junk to dig through, because this is where overland waste goes
- In stage ideas for items: pickaxe for climbing, tools to repair beams, vehicles, bridges, cannons, things for Nerville; tools to disable or destroy electric fences, sentry guns, obstacles
- When REX and Nerville are paired, they can join together to perform combo moves
