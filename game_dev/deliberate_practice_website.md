This is a fantastic creative project that's perfect for deliberate practice! You have a clear vision and concrete constraints, which makes designing a practice structure much easier. Let me break this down into deliberate practice components.

## Micro-Skills Breakdown for Interactive 3D Web Experience

**3D Asset Creation (Blender)**

- Modeling efficiency (low-poly to detailed workflow)
- UV unwrapping and texturing pipeline
- Animation rigging for interactive objects
- Optimization for web (poly count, texture sizes)

**React Three Fiber Development**

- Scene composition and lighting
- Interactive object state management
- Performance optimization (LOD, culling, batching)
- User input handling in 3D space

**Narrative Experience Design**

- Environmental storytelling through 3D spaces
- Progressive revelation mechanics
- User agency vs guided experience balance
- Atmosphere building through audio/visual cues

**Technical Integration**

- Asset pipeline (Blender → React Three Fiber)
- Loading optimization and progressive enhancement
- Mobile/desktop responsive 3D experiences
- Deployment and performance monitoring

## Deliberate Practice Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Months 1-2)

**Weekly 3D Asset Challenges** (3-4 hours/week):

- **Monday**: Model one ship interior object (chair, console, window)
- **Wednesday**: Texture and optimize it for web
- **Friday**: Import to React Three Fiber and make it interactive
- **Sunday**: Critique session - compare your work to reference art, identify specific improvement areas

**Feedback Mechanism**:

- Track polygon count vs visual quality ratio
- Time yourself on common modeling tasks
- Test your assets on mobile devices for performance
- Keep a visual progress gallery

**Progressive Difficulty**:

- Week 1-2: Simple geometric objects
- Week 3-4: Organic shapes (cushions, plants)
- Week 5-6: Complex mechanical objects (control panels)
- Week 7-8: Character/creature modeling

### Phase 2: Interactive System Building (Months 2-4)

**Bi-weekly Technical Prototypes** (6-8 hours/prototype):

- **Prototype 1**: Room-scale navigation system
- **Prototype 2**: Object examination/interaction system
- **Prototype 3**: Environmental storytelling triggers
- **Prototype 4**: Audio-reactive visual elements
- **Prototype 5**: Memory/consciousness distortion effects
- **Prototype 6**: Mobile-responsive 3D interface

**Structure for Each Prototype**:

- **Planning** (1 hour): Sketch the interaction, identify technical challenges
- **Implementation** (4-5 hours): Build it, expecting to get stuck
- **Polish** (1 hour): Make it feel smooth and responsive
- **Analysis** (1 hour): What worked? What was harder than expected? What would you do differently?

**Feedback Mechanism**:

- User test each prototype with 2-3 people
- Measure frame rates on different devices
- Track development time vs feature complexity
- Document reusable patterns you discover

### Phase 3: Narrative Experience Integration (Months 3-5)

**Weekly Story Beats** (2-3 hours/week):
Instead of trying to build the whole experience at once, create one "story moment" per week:

- **Week 1**: Wake up sequence - lighting, audio, gradual UI reveal
- **Week 2**: First exploration - movement tutorial through environmental design
- **Week 3**: Discovery moment - finding something that hints at the truth
- **Week 4**: Confusion/glitch effect - reality distortion mechanics
- **Week 5**: Memory fragment - flashback or data access sequence
- **Week 6**: Growing awareness - subtle UI changes that suggest consciousness
- **Week 7**: Revelation setup - environmental changes that build tension
- **Week 8**: Truth reveal - dramatic visual/audio shift

**Deliberate Practice Element**: For each story beat, constraint yourself:

- Must be completable in one sitting (5-10 minutes max)
- Must work without text/dialogue
- Must be effective on mobile
- Must advance the narrative through interaction, not exposition

## Overcoming Passive Learning Patterns

Since you mentioned consuming Three.js Journey passively, here's how to flip that:

**Active Reconstruction Method**:

1. Watch a lesson but don't code along
2. Close the video and try to recreate the effect from memory
3. Get stuck, struggle for 20 minutes
4. Go back to video for specific help
5. Implement your own variation

**The "Teaching Test"**:
After each Three.js concept, create a 2-minute screen recording explaining it to someone else. This forces active processing.

**Parameter Experimentation**:
Instead of using the tutorial's exact values, always ask "what happens if I change this?" Spend 15 minutes breaking things intentionally.

## Asset Pipeline Optimization Practice

**Weekly Pipeline Challenges**:

- **Week 1**: Model → Texture → Export in under 2 hours
- **Week 2**: Same pipeline in 90 minutes
- **Week 3**: Add animation, maintain time constraint
- **Week 4**: Optimize for mobile without losing visual impact

**Measurement**: Track your pipeline efficiency and visual quality separately. You want both to improve over time.

## Project Scope Management

Given your ambitious timeline, use deliberate practice to manage scope creep:

**Monthly Scope Reviews**:

- List what you've built vs. what you planned
- Identify features that took longer than expected
- Cut or simplify features that don't serve the core narrative
- Add details that enhance the story's emotional impact

**The "One-Page Game Design" Exercise**:
Write your entire experience concept on one page. If you can't, it's too complex. Revise monthly as you learn what's actually feasible.

## Integration with Game Development Learning

**Godot Skill Transfer Practice**:
Even though your main project is web-based, spend 1-2 hours weekly applying Godot concepts to your React Three Fiber work:

- Scene management principles
- State machines for interactions
- Audio system design
- Performance profiling techniques

This cross-pollination will make you stronger at both and give you a backup plan if web deployment becomes limiting.

## Progress Tracking Dashboard

Create a simple progress tracker:

- **Assets completed** vs. **total needed**
- **Story beats implemented** vs. **planned**
- **Mobile performance** (FPS on target device)
- **User feedback scores** (confusion, engagement, technical issues)
- **Development velocity** (features per week)

## Immediate Action Plan

**Week 1**: Set up your basic React Three Fiber environment and import one simple Blender object
**Week 2**: Make that object interactive (clickable, animated)
**Week 3**: Create your first story beat (wake up sequence)
**Week 4**: Test on mobile and optimize

The key insight from your AI engineering practice applies here: focus on completing small, working prototypes rather than trying to build the perfect final experience. Each prototype should be a complete micro-experience that works end-to-end.

Your background gives you a huge advantage - you understand software architecture and can think systematically about user experience. The main deliberate practice challenge will be developing visual/spatial intuition and efficient 3D workflows.

What aspect of this feels most intimidating right now? That's probably where you should focus your first deliberate practice cycle.
