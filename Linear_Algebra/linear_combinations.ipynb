    "not so bad, there you have 2 2d vectors. typically in linear algebra the notation would be to have them vertical as col vectors. [1,1] is 3 things. it is that column, it is also the  point in space 1,1, and it is also an arrow, visual vector of unit magnitude starting at the origin of its coordinate system and going to point 1,1. technically that is a normalized vector because all the components, the values of the dimensions are 1. does that mean (0,0) and (1,1) line is 1 as well? euclidean distance woudl be sqrt of sum of squared differences between distance right, so guessing that is 1 - 0 squared + 1 - 0 squared, which is 1 + 1, that is 2, then sqrt of 2, so not at all 1.And it turns out I was wrong, good thing I'm studying! normalized vector has a magnitude of 1. I knew that, but I guess not solidly enough that I didn't have to work it out. so vector with (1,1) is not normalized.   "

Turns out a lot. with vec1, I could scale it so that I could get it to be any point along the infinite line (in both directions) that is parallel with (1, 1). picking a few coefficients at random, say instead of 2 I picked -1000, or 50.25.

    "so then with these things in mind, Strang starts to give students a preview of how far they are going to go by going ferom this to linear combinations. that is what we showed before, where you have two or more vectors being added and each one is being scaled by some coefficient. Whereas in the thing we just talked about with one vector, you could only represent a line, with two vectors you can represent a plane. That is another leap of understanding, which I feel ilke can be articulated though in a way that isn't too confusing. "

Well, I still need to work my way through it. So [1,0,0] would be a vector going one on the x axis and then not being on either the y or z. if the left hand side described a solution that covered all of 3d space, then I'd expect this point to exist in that volume. So this implies that the left hand side is forming an infinite plane instead of an infinite 3d space. I might have trouble seeing that without plotting it, but let me try. first, I'll sample a bunch of values for each and see what it looks like: "
