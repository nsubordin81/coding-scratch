    "not so bad, there you have 2 2d vectors. typically in linear algebra the notation would be to have them vertical as col vectors. [1,1] is 3 things. it is that column, it is also the  point in space 1,1, and it is also an arrow, visual vector of unit magnitude starting at the origin of its coordinate system and going to point 1,1. technically that is a normalized vector because all the components, the values of the dimensions are 1. does that mean (0,0) and (1,1) line is 1 as well? euclidean distance woudl be sqrt of sum of squared differences between distance right, so guessing that is 1 - 0 squared + 1 - 0 squared, which is 1 + 1, that is 2, then sqrt of 2, so not at all 1.And it turns out I was wrong, good thing I'm studying! normalized vector has a magnitude of 1. I knew that, but I guess not solidly enough that I didn't have to work it out. so vector with (1,1) is not normalized.   "

    "nice, so that is just multiplying 2 by each component. so far so easy. but the thing that linear algebra does that gives everyone a headache is leap from this to thinking about unknowns in the equations. so if it wasn't 2 that I was using, but I could instead pick any number, what are the implications? Turns out a lot. with vec1, I could scale it so that I could get it to be any point along the infinite line (in both directions) that is parallel with (1, 1). picking a few coefficients at random, say instead of 2 I picked -1000, or 50.25.

    "picking (1,1) makes it easier to see. the slope is the same for these because it is 1. teh origin will also be the same as 0,0 because that is where all single vectors are based from. so I can create any point on that line. I also can't create points off of that line, since the scaling happens to both vector components, so as much as I grow the purely 'horizontal' x part I'm going to also grow the purely 'vertical' y part ivery time.

    "so then with these things in mind, Strang starts to give students a preview of how far they are going to go by going ferom this to linear combinations. that is what we showed before, where you have two or more vectors being added and each one is being scaled by some coefficient. Whereas in the thing we just talked about with one vector, you could only represent a line, with two vectors you can represent a plane. That is another leap of understanding, which I feel ilke can be articulated though in a way that isn't too confusing. "

    "we couldn't chagne the slope of the line vector when pickign different values for the coefficient, but if we have two vectors that don't have the same slope starting at the origin and we are scaling them both, we have all the values on two infinite lines. it turns out that all the values on two infinite lines, no matter what their slopes are, can represent every point on the plane those two lines are on. why? well, it takes a bit of visualization, but since the point that results from adding these vectors comes from drawing a parallelogram of some sort that results from putting them head to tail, if you imagine those lines getting longer and shorter but not at the same rate, it starts to feel intuitive that you could arbitrarily move that result point up, down, left or right anywhere on the x, y coordinate system.
